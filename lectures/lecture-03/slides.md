# Sunny Tees: Boosting T-Shirt Sales

---

## Situation
Sunny Tees sells 1,000 t-shirts per month through its online store.

---

## Complication
Last month, sales dropped to 700 t-shirts, even though website traffic stayed the same.

---

## Question
Why did sales drop, and what should Sunny Tees do to boost them?

---

## Answer/Recommendation
**Improve product descriptions, add customer reviews, and adjust pricing to increase t-shirt sales.**

---

## Supporting Arguments

### 1. Increase Sales Through Competitive Pricing
- Lowering the price slightly makes t-shirts more attractive to price-sensitive customers.  
- A competitive price can convert hesitant visitors into buyers and drive volume.

### 2. Build Trust Through Social Proof
- Customer reviews show that others have bought and liked the product.  
- Positive reviews increase buyer confidence and encourage more purchases.

# SCQA + Pyramid for M15 at 1st Ave & 57th Street

---

## Situation
The M15 bus line serves thousands of riders daily along 1st and 2nd Avenue in Manhattan.

---

## Complication
Buses frequently experience long delays at the intersection of 1st Avenue and 57th Street due to congestion near the bridge during peak hours.

#Hello

---

## Question
How can the MTA reduce delays at this intersection and improve reliability for M15 riders?

---

## Answer/Recommendation
**Deploy traffic cops during peak hours and optimize bus signal priority at the intersection to reduce delays and improve service reliability.**

---

## Supporting Arguments

### 1. Reduce Congestion with Targeted Traffic Management
- Placing traffic cops at 1st Ave & 57th St during peak hours helps manage vehicle flow.  
- Clearing bottlenecks at critical times allows buses to move more quickly and consistently.

### 2. Improve Bus Flow with Signal Optimization
- Adjusting traffic signals to prioritize buses reduces waiting time at red lights.  
- Coordinated signals help maintain bus schedules and reduce passenger frustration.

# Assignment: Create Your Own SCQA + Pyramid Scenario


## How to Structure Your Scenario

- **Situation:** Describe the current state.
- **Complication:** Identify the problem or challenge.
- **Question:** Ask what needs to be solved.
- **Answer/Recommendation:** Propose a solution or next step.

**2. Pyramid Principle**

# The Assertion–Evidence Framework

## Assertion
**Each slide should make one clear statement.**

## Evidence
- Use visuals (charts, diagrams, photos) to support your claim.  
- Keep text minimal—avoid long paragraphs.  
- The audience should be able to read the slide quickly and understand the point.  
- Evidence should **directly back up** your assertion, not introduce new ideas.  

## Key Idea
**Slide = One Idea + Visual Proof**  
This makes your presentation **clear, persuasive, and memorable**.
