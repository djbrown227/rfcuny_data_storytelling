# Data Insights, Visualizations, and Tooling: ABLE & ACE

**Instructor:** Daniel Brown  
**Course Goal:** Equip students to produce a winning datathon project on **Automated Bus Lane Enforcement (ABLE)** and **Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE)**. In addition, students will create **several small projects and visualizations** to showcase to prospective employers, **learn what makes a compelling data story**, and explore how to leverage **LLMs to achieve data analysis goals**. The focus is on **telling a data story and persuading people through your analysis**, with some exposure to basic statistics and machine learning.

> **Note:** This course repository will be **regularly updated** with new lectures, notebooks, assignments, and resources **up until the first day of class and continuing after**, so check back often for the latest materials.

## Course Overview

This course is designed to guide students through the full lifecycle of a data science project with a focus on transportation enforcement data. By the end of the course, students will:

- Gain practical experience working with **real-world datasets** related to ABLE and ACE.  
- Learn to **analyze, visualize, and communicate data insights** effectively.  
- Develop the skills to **tell compelling data stories** and persuade an audience.  
- Produce a **datathon-ready project** and several **portfolio-worthy small projects or graphs**.  
- Explore using **LLMs** to support data analysis workflows and insights.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into **lectures and assignments**:

- **Lectures (`lectures/`)**  
  Slide decks are built with [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) and cover key concepts, techniques, and examples. Each lecture includes an `assets/` folder with diagrams, charts, and logos.  

- **Notebooks (`notebooks/`)**  
  Hands-on Jupyter notebooks accompany each lecture, with live coding examples, exercises, and in-class assignments.  

- **Assignments (`assignments/`)**  
  Weekly assignments challenge students to apply the concepts learned, create visualizations, and analyze data.  

- **Environment (`environment/`)**  
  Includes a reproducible Python environment (`environment.yml`) for all notebooks, ensuring consistency across systems.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this course, students will:

- Gain confidence in **analyzing and visualizing data**.  
- Learn **how to tell a story with data** and persuade audiences through insights.  
- Produce **portfolio-ready projects and visualizations** to showcase to employers.  
- Explore how **LLMs can assist in data analysis workflows**.  
- Understand basic **statistics and machine learning concepts** in context.  

> The emphasis is on **storytelling, persuasion, and practical application** rather than theory-heavy content.
